# SpaceInvadersAVR
For my Embedded Systems class, I created a Space Invaders game using an ST7735 LCD Graphic Display. The required constraint was to only use the AVR library and not the arduino library, meaning that I needed a high level bit-by-bit understanding of the LCD display, along with my other components, in able to create the game.
